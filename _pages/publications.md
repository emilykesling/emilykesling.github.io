**Medical Texts in Anglo-Saxon Literary Culture** D.S. Brewer: Cambridge, 2020.

This book offers the first comprehensive analysis of the literary and historical contexts of the four vernacular medical collections extant from Anglo-Saxon England. This study positions these texts as products of a learned literary culture, arguing that all four collections were produced in major ecclesiastical centres. The final chapter considers the fundamentally positive depiction of doctors and medicine found within literary and ecclesiastical works from the period and suggests that the high esteem for medicine in literate circles may have favoured the study and translation of medical texts. This book was the winner of the prize for Best First Monograph given biennially by the International Society for the Study of Early Medieval England (ISSEME).

**The Artistry of Bald?s Colophon**  *Anglo-Saxon England* 48 (2021) [forthcoming]

*Bald?s Leechbook*, the most famous of the Old English medical collections, derives its name from a colophon in Latin hexameter verse that occurs on the final folio of the collection. This article examines for the first time the form of the colophon and its character as a work of Anglo-Latin verse as well as the influence of possible literary models from Anglo-Saxon England and the Continent.
