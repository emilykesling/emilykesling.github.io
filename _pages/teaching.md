I have been actively engaged in teaching on medieval topics since 2014. While completing my doctoral work at the University of Oxford, I served as Lecturer I in Old English at Magdalen College.  As part of this position, I taught lower and upper-level undergraduate courses on Old and early Middle English texts. During this time I was also made an Associate Fellow of the *Higher Education Academy* (HEA). I also taught for a shorter period at Jesus and Oriel Colleges and gave a lecture series of my own design on Literature and the Anglo-Saxon Church.Between 2018 and 2021, I taught at the University of Oslo. I contributed lectures and seminars to co-taught courses in Old English and Interdisciplinary Philology. I also created my own course on the [History of Early Medieval England]{ https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/iakh/HIS2124/}, which was cross-listed for both bachelor and master students.  I have also supervised and examined master?s theses on a variety of subjects in both history and literature.![A teaching trip I organized for students to see Old English poem Caedmon?s Hymn in its manuscript context. *Photo taken from the Magdalen College Record*]{manuscript-class.png}
