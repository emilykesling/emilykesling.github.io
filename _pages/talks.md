I have given a wide variety of talks on subjects related to the early Middle Ages. Recent talks I have given have been included as part of the [Loyola Medieval Lecture Series](Loyola-Talk.jpeg) and the symposium [Rethinking English Literary Culture in the Age of Alfred](Alfred-Symposium.png). 

I also give pubic talks on topics in Old English, medieval history, and medieval medicine.  If you would like me to give a talk, please get in touch.
